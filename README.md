## Small Exercise: Counting Cards

JavaScript, HTML & CSS

Building on Exercise to make include a web front end.

Exercise Instructions:

You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter and increment or decrement the global count 
variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and 
the string "Bet" if the count is positive, or "Hold" if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the 
player's decision ("Bet" or "Hold") should be separated by a single space.
